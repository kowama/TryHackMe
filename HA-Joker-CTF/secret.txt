Batman hits Joker.
Joker: "Bats you may be a rock but you won't break me." (Laughs!)
Batman: "I will break you with this rock. You made a mistake now."
Joker: "This is one of your 100 poor jokes, when will you get a sense of humor bats! You are dumb as a rock."
Joker: "HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA!"
