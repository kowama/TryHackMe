I like to keep a track of the various things I do throughout the day.

Things I have done today:
 - Added a note for JBoss to read for when he next logs in.
 - Helped Tony setup his website!
 - Made sure that I am not an administrator account 

Things to do:
 - Update my Java! I've heard it's kind of in-secure, but it's such a headache to update. Grrr!
