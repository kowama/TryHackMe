Hey JBoss!

Following your email, I have tried to replicate the issues you were having with the system.

However, I don't know what commands you executed - is there any file where this history is stored that I can access?

Oh! I almost forgot... I have reset your password as requested (make sure not to tell it to anyone!)

Kind Regards,
